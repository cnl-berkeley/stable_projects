### Instructions for use ### 
  - To run statistical analyses and generate relevant figures, open and run the *.R* and *.ipynb* files included in these respective folders: */R_stats_plots* and */LASSO*.
 
### Dependencies, Requirements, and Associated data ###
  - R, RStudio, and Python are required to run the *.R* and *.ipynb* files in the *R_stats_plots* and *LASSO* folders.
  
  - All associated data needed to implement statistical analyses and generate figures is included in the *R_stats_plots* and *LASSO* folders.

  - All necessary R packages are provided at the beginning of */R_stats_plots/LPC_plots_and_analyses.R*.
  
  - All necessary Python packages are provided at the beginning of */LASSO/Lasso.ipynb*.
  
  - Access maximum probability maps (MPMs): spatial probability maps in fsaverage surface space can be found in the *MPMs.zip* folder.
    - Thresholded and unthresholded maps are included for each sulcus. The code to project these MPMs to individual surfaces is also included.
