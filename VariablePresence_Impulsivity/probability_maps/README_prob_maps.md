## Projected Labels
This code projects the sulcal probabilistic maps from fsaverage space to native space in a given participant. 
  - *mri_label2label.sh*: Run this code to project probability maps from fsaverage onto individual surfaces.

## Requirements
  - Must have created cortical reconstructions from each participant's MRI scan using the standard [standard FreeSurfer pipeline](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/).
