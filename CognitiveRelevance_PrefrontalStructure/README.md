### Instructions for use ### 
  - To run statistical analyses and generate relevant figures open and run the R file included in this repository: *PIMFS_analysis_final.R*.
 
### Dependencies, Requirements, and Associated data ###
  - [R](https://www.r-project.org) and [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) are required to run *PIMFS_analysis_final.R*.

  - All necessary R packages are provided at the beginning of *PIMFS_analysis_final.R*.
  
  - Access probability maps: spatial probability maps projected onto the fsaverage space can be found in the *probability_maps* directory. Thresholded and unthresholded maps are included for each label. The code used to generate these maps and code to project them to individual surfaces are also included in the directory.
  
  - All associated data needed to implement statistical analyses and generate figures is included in the file: *data*.
